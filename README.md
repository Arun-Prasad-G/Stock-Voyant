# ðŸ“ˆ Stock-Voyant


This project is a hybrid machine learning and deep learning web application designed to **predict future stock prices and volatility**. It uses historical stock data to train a **hybrid model** that combines LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks and Random Forest regressors for more accurate forecasting.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload your own **stock price CSV** file.
- Predict future **stock prices** and **volatility** for a specified number of days.
- Combines deep learning (LSTM) and traditional machine learning (Random Forest).
- Scaled, sequence-based time series modeling.
- Interactive, user-friendly **web interface** built with Python full stack.
